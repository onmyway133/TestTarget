    # Due to the `pending` specs using a `print` xctool fails generating the report,
    # which in turn makes the tests fail.
    # See https://github.com/facebook/xctool/issues/314#issuecomment-152988101 and comments
    # for details.
    # See https://circleci.com/gh/mokagio/Quick/12 for a proof that without `print` the test pass.
